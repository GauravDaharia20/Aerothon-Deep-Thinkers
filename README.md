When companies want to test how the users engage with the website, they hire some labs to recruit some volunteers and pay them. 
They also need some expensive tech tools to do that.With the advancements in Machine Learning, everything has changed.
We built a solution(prototype) to track the mouse-movements and eye-movements.
A research by says, only ~60 percent of mouse and eye movements correlate.We could use existing platforms like hotjar to get the mouse-tracking heatmap info.
We get the eye-tracking data from the site, from volunteering users.We can then combine them to test how users are using the website, where and why they'll possibly get struck.
And use that info to tweak the placement of elements on the webpage.The glimpse of working of our website can be found in 'Features' Section of our webpage.
There may be bugs, but we have done our best to rectify them.Happy Hacking :)
